# Shipper: Kubernetes native multi-cluster canary or blue-green rollouts

Shipper is a set of controllers for orchestrating rollouts to multiple
Kubernetes clusters. It uses Helm charts and CRDs to specify what should be
deployed, and how it should be rolled out.

## WIP

Shipper is in active use inside Booking.com, but we have a ways to go before it is
a consumable open source product. If you're reading this note on HEAD, it means
we're still working on our first round of docs, installation guides,
communication channels, and so on. Please bear with us while we make the
transition from internal to external :)
